# Security and Disclosure Information Policy for the Podman Desktop Project

This is the security policy for the Podman Desktop project. It applies to all repositories
in the [Podman Desktop GitHub organization](https://github.com/podman-desktop).

- [Reporting a Vulnerability](#Reporting-a-Vulnerability)
- [Security Announcements](#Security-Announcements)
- [Security Vulnerability Response](#Security-Vulnerability-Response)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've identified a security issue in a Podman Desktop project,
please **DO NOT** report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker,
mailing list, or chat. Instead, you have two options:

- Open a private GitHub Security Vulnerability Advisory
  ([GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/report-a-vulnerability/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)).
- Send an email with as many details as possible to
  [cncf-podman-desktop-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-podman-desktop-security@lists.cncf.io?subject=Security%20Vunerablity%20Report).
  This is a private mailing list for the core maintainers.

## Security Announcements

The [cncf-podman-desktop-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-podman-desktop-maintainers@lists.cncf.io) email
list is used for messages about Podman Desktop security announcements as well as general announcements and discussions.
You can join the list [here](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-podman-desktop-maintainers/join)
or by sending an email to [cncf-podman-desktop-maintainers+subscribe@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-podman-desktop-maintainers+subscribe@lists.cncf.io?subject=subscribe).

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the core maintainers within 3 working days.

Any vulnerability information shared with core maintainers stays within a Podman Desktop project
and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

As the security issue moves from triage, to an identified fix, to release planning, the core
maintainers will keep the reporter updated.
