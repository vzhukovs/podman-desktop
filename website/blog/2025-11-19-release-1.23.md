Podman Desktop 1.23 Release! 🎉

![podman-desktop-hero-1.23](/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.23/banner.png)

Podman Desktop 1.23 is now available. [Click here to download it](/downloads)!

This release brings exciting new features and improvements:

- **Dedicated network page**: Manage networks on their own page. Configure networks entirely without touching the terminal.
- **Customizable columns and dashboard sections**: Show only what matters to you. Rearrange columns and sections to your liking.
- **Enhanced search**: Find containers, images, and documentation faster without hunting through menus.
- **Added rootless or rootful indicator to Podman machines**: Adds a visual indication in the 'Resources' section of whether a Podman machine is rootful or rootless.
- **Support for a managed configuration**: IT teams can deploy pre-configured settings organization-wide. Administrators get consistent, ready-to-be-used Podman Desktop with managed settings already set up.
- **Created Docker context for Podman machine**: Improved compatibility with Docker contexts.

## Release details

### Podman network support

This release introduces a dedicated network page that brings Podman network management directly into Podman Desktop's UI. Previously, managing networks required using the command-line interface, but now you can handle all your networking needs through the new network page.

The network page provides comprehensive visibility into your container networks, displaying essential information including network IDs, names, drivers, and their associated container engine environments.

This feature is particularly valuable when working with complex multi-container applications that require isolated network environments, or when you need to configure custom network settings (such as DNS) for your containers.

Seet he [`podman network` command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html) for more information.

  }}

### Customizable columns and dashboard sections

The new layout manager feature allows users to customize their dashboard sections and table columns to match their workflow preferences. Users can now reorder dashboard sections, show or hide specific table columns, and tailor their view to display only the most relevant information for their tasks.

  }}
/>

### Enhanced search

The search bar has been enhanced with algorithmic text highlighting, quick navigation to application sections, and the ability to search for Podman resources (containers, images, pods, volumes) directly. The search bar now provides a command palette-like experience for faster navigation throughout the application.

/>

### Added rootless or rootful indicator to Podman machines

Podman can run with or without root privileges, in Podman Desktop we received feedback that this nuance was not displayed in the UI, leading sometimes to some issues!

We've listened! We thank those who have used our built-in feedback functionality and submitted feedback.

To address this aspect following user feedback we added an indicator inside the `Settings > Resources` page to properly display if a machine is rootless or not.

A visual indicator now shows whether each Podman machine is running in rootless or rootful mode in the resources section. This helps users quickly identify the execution mode of their machines, making it easier to diagnose permission-related issues and follow security best practices.

See how you can enable/disable root privileges by editing your [Podman machine](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.22#switching-podman-machines-between-rootless-and-rootful-macos-and-windows-only).

  }}
/>

### Update Podman to v5.7.0

Updated the Podman engine to version 5.7.0. This update fixes one critical bug [CVE-2025-52881](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm) as well as adding multiple features and bug fixes. Such as adding enhanced security support for the remote Podman client and `podman system service` API server, which now supports encrypting connections with TLS and mTLS, including client authentication by certificate; the `podman system connection add` command has been updated to use this capability when creating connections to TCP sockets.

Check out the [Podman 5.7](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.7.0) release.

### Support for a managed configuration

Podman Desktop now supports managed configuration. Users can add a “managed-by” configuration file to enforce specific settings. This allows system administrators to apply configurations from a global system file. With this release, administrators can deploy a managed settings file to a predefined system location, enabling centralized control over Podman Desktop configurations across an entire organization.

### Created Docker context for Podman machine

Podman Desktop now automatically creates a Docker context for each registered Podman machine, improving interoperability with Docker tooling. Each context is prefixed with `podman-` and derived from the Podman machine name, allowing users to seamlessly switch between contexts using the standard `docker context use` command.
