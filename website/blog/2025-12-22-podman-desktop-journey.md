# The Journey of Podman Desktop in 2025

## A Year of Growth and Gratitude

Welcome to the journey of **Podman Desktop in 2025**, a year that marked incredible growth, deeper integrations, and continued community collaboration.

This year Podman Desktop **closed 1,669 issues, merged 2,814 pull requests, and welcomed 28 new contributors**, with even more activity happening across extension repositories.

It’s been almost a year since Podman Desktop became a [**CNCF Sandbox Project (November 2024)**](https://www.cncf.io/projects/podman-desktop/) and what a journey it’s been! From passing [\*\*three million downloads\*\*](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/3-million) to introducing new extensions, integrations and platform support, the project has seen remarkable progress, driven by passionate contributors and an engaged community.

This blog takes you through some of the key highlights of **2025**.

## A Fresh Start in January

We kicked off the year strong with the [**Podman Desktop 1.16**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.16) release, setting the tone for an exciting year ahead.

This release introduced a new **Experimental** section in Settings, giving users visibility into features under active development and linking them directly to community discussions.

### Highlights included:

- **Improved visibility:** Providers moved from the Dashboard to the Status Bar for quicker engine status insights.
- **Smarter cleanup:** Ability to prune only untagged images for better system hygiene.
- **Log search:** Search directly within container or pod logs from the UI.

Beyond the core app, the [**BootC extension**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/bootc-release-1.6) gained traction, enabling workflows that turn containers into bootable images.

A great start to a year where the ecosystem began expanding beyond just the main application.

## The Spring Push (March – May)

Spring brought rapid iteration across releases [**1.17**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.17), [**1.18**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.18), and [**1.19**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.19) continuing Podman Desktop’s rhythm of monthly improvements.

### Key highlights:

- **Podman Engine 5.5** shipped, improving reliability and performance.
- **Registry mirror configuration** Simplify registry mirroring setup with a dedicated command.
- **Smoother kind cluster experience** Spin up a Kubernetes cluster effortlessly, even without a pre-installed kind binary.
- **Switching Kubernetes namespace** Switching between Kubernetes namespaces within Podman Desktop is now available.
- **Jobs in Kubernetes** You can now see Kubernetes jobs in our growing Kubernetes section of Podman Desktop.
- **Experimental status bar providers enhancements** Status bar providers can be pinned and unpinned based on user preferences and the provider status icons have been updated to be easier to understand.

Along with addition and updates to the extension catalog

This phase showcased Podman Desktop’s versatility, evolving into a platform for container, Kubernetes, and AI development.

## Summer Growth (July – August)

Mid-year releases [**v1.20**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.20) and [**v1.21**](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.21) focused on usability improvements and developer convenience.

### Highlights:

- **Bulk-run containers:** Start multiple containers at once—perfect for local stack setups.
- **Cluster & user switching:** Easier context switching between Kubernetes clusters.
- **Extension discoverability:** Search by description, not just name.
- **Notification redesign:** Cleaner, more consistent visuals.
- **Duplicate installation detection:** Helps users resolve conflicting Podman installs.
- **Podman Engine 5.6** integrated.

These updates reflected increasing maturity, subtle but meaningful refinements that improved everyday workflows.
