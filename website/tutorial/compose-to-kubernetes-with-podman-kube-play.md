You do not need a full rewrite to start moving from Compose to Kubernetes.

This tutorial uses the existing `guestbook-compose` sample from `podman-desktop-demo` and walks through a practical migration flow:

1. Run the app with Compose.
2. Convert `compose.yaml` to Kubernetes YAML with `kompose`.
3. Run the generated manifests locally with `podman kube play`.

## Why this migration path

- Keep your current Compose workflow while adopting Kubernetes step by step.
- Validate generated manifests locally before touching a real cluster.
- Catch gaps early and reduce production migration risk.

## Prerequisites

- Podman Desktop: [Download Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads)
- Podman CLI (`podman`) available. If you installed Podman through Podman Desktop onboarding, it is already included (check with `podman --version`).
- Kompose: [kompose.io](https://kompose.io/)

On macOS or Windows, ensure your Podman machine is running in **Settings > Resources**.

## Why this tutorial starts with podman kube play

This guide uses `podman kube play` as a local pre-validation step. The goal is to quickly check that generated manifests are runnable before investing time in full cluster setup.

This step does not replace validation on a real Kubernetes engine. After local validation, you may run the same manifests on `microshift`, `minikube`, or `kind` to confirm real cluster behavior.

## Step 1: run the existing Compose app

Clone the demo repository and open the existing sample:

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo.git
$ cd podman-desktop-demo/guestbook-compose
```

Start the stack (recommended in foreground for easier debugging):

```shell-session
$ podman compose -f compose.yaml up --build
```

Keep this terminal open. Run the next commands from a second terminal.

If you prefer detached mode, use:

```shell-session
$ podman compose -f compose.yaml up -d --build
```

Open the guestbook UI:

- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

  }}
/>

## Step 2: convert Compose to Kubernetes YAML

Generate Kubernetes manifests from the Compose file:

```shell-session
$ kompose convert --stdout -f compose.yaml > guestbook-kube.yaml
```

This conversion is file-based and works even if Podman pods are not present.

You may see this warning during conversion:

```text
WARN Service "redis-replica" won't be created because 'ports' is not specified
```

This is expected for this sample. `redis-replica` is internal-only, so it does not publish host ports. Kompose can still generate the workload resources needed for local validation with `podman kube play`.

sources={{
    light: require('./img/from-compose-to-kubernetes-with-podman-kube-play/step-2-generated-yaml.png').default,
    dark: require('./img/from-compose-to-kubernetes-with-podman-kube-play/step-2-generated-yaml.png').default,
  }}
/>

## Step 3: run Kubernetes YAML locally

Stop Compose first:

If you started Compose in foreground mode, press `Ctrl-C` in the first terminal.

If you started Compose in detached mode, run:

```shell-session
$ podman compose -f compose.yaml down
```

Run the generated YAML:

```shell-session
$ podman kube play --replace --publish-all guestbook-kube.yaml
```

At this point, you crossed the first Kubernetes boundary:

- Your app is no longer started from Compose
- Your app is now started from Kubernetes manifests
- Podman executes those manifests locally so you can validate behavior

Verify the app:

- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

  }}
/>

## Step 4: before using a real cluster

This sample validates migration flow, not production readiness.

Before production:

- Replace demo settings and credentials
- Add readiness/liveness probes and resource requests/limits
- Add ingress/TLS and storage policies
- Add CI checks and image/dependency scanning

## What Kompose migration covers and what it does not

What Kompose generally covers well:

- Basic service definitions and container images
- Environment variables
- Simple port mappings
- Straightforward volume mappings

What typically needs manual follow-up:

- Ingress and external exposure strategy
- Probe tuning and resource requests/limits
- Storage classes and cluster-specific persistence behavior
- RBAC, security policies, and network policies
- Advanced scheduling and autoscaling

## What kube play validates vs a real Kubernetes engine

What `podman kube play` validates in this tutorial:

- Generated manifests are runnable locally
- Basic container wiring and service reachability
- Fast local smoke checks for migration flow

What a real Kubernetes engine additionally validates:

- Scheduler and full cluster networking behavior
- Ingress/controller integration
- Production auth, RBAC, and policy enforcement
- Distro/cloud-specific operational behavior

## Cleanup

```shell-session
$ podman compose -f compose.yaml down -v
$ podman kube down guestbook-kube.yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

- Port already in use (`8080`): stop conflicting containers, then rerun.
- Local image pull error for `web`: ensure Compose build completed before `kube play`.
- `kompose` not found: install from [kompose.io](https://kompose.io/).
- `kube play` issues after retries: run `podman kube down guestbook-kube.yaml` and retry.
