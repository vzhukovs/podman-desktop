# AGENTS.md

This file provides **Podman Desktop-specific** guidance for E2E test automation in the `tests/playwright` directory.

> **For general Playwright patterns, best practices, and examples**, always refer to the [`playwright-testing` skill](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/SKILL.md) first. This document only covers what's **unique to Podman Desktop**.

## AI Agent Quick Reference

**When implementing Playwright tests for Podman Desktop:**

1. **Start with the skill**: [`playwright-testing`](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/SKILL.md) → [examples](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/examples.md) → [reference](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/reference.md)
2. **Apply PD-specific patterns** documented below
3. **Check existing tests** in [src/specs/](src/specs/) for reference

## Overview

- **Framework:** Playwright with Electron support (experimental)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.9+ (strict mode)
- **Package:** `@podman-desktop/tests-playwright` (published to npm)
- **Architecture:** Electron app testing with custom fixtures

## Quick Commands

```bash
# From repository root
pnpm test:e2e              # Build + run E2E tests (excludes @k8s_e2e)
pnpm test:e2e:smoke        # Build + run smoke tests
pnpm test:e2e:k8s          # Build + run Kubernetes tests

# Build once, run multiple times (when codebase unchanged)
pnpm test:e2e:build        # Build test package
pnpm test:e2e:run          # Run tests without rebuild
pnpm test:e2e:smoke:run    # Run smoke tests without rebuild
pnpm test:e2e:k8s:run      # Run K8s tests without rebuild

# Run a specific suite by name (searches specs/ and special-specs/)
pnpm test:e2e:suite volume-smoke          # Run volume smoke tests
pnpm test:e2e:suite installation          # Run installation tests
pnpm test:e2e:suite ui-stress -g @ui-stress  # Run with tag filter
pnpm test:e2e:suite:build volume-smoke    # Build + run specific suite

# Development
pnpm exec playwright test tests/playwright/src/specs/volume-smoke.spec.ts --ui
pnpm exec playwright show-report tests/playwright/output/html-results
```

> **Tip:** After running `test:e2e:build` once, use the `:run` variants (e.g., `test:e2e:smoke:run`) or `test:e2e:suite <name>` to skip rebuilding if no code changes were made. This significantly speeds up iteration.
>
> **Suite runner:** All `:run` scripts use the shared `tests/playwright/scripts/run-e2e-suite.mjs` runner. For ad-hoc runs of suites without a dedicated script (e.g., pdmachine, experimental, extension, remote, ui-stress), use `pnpm test:e2e:suite <name> [extra-playwright-args]`.

## Podman Desktop-Specific Patterns

### 1. Custom Fixtures

**Always use these fixtures** from [src/utility/fixtures.ts](src/utility/fixtures.ts):

```typescript
import { expect as playExpect, test } from '/@/utility/fixtures';
// NOT: import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';

test('My test', async ({ runner, navigationBar, welcomePage, statusBar, page }) => {
  // runner: Electron app launcher
  // navigationBar: App navigation (openContainers, openImages, etc.)
  // welcomePage: Welcome page handler
  // statusBar: Status bar interactions
  // page: Main Playwright Page
});
```

### 2. Test Setup Pattern

**Standard test setup:**

```typescript
import { expect as playExpect, test } from '/@/utility/fixtures';
import { waitForPodmanMachineStartup } from '/@/utility/wait';

test.beforeAll(async ({ runner, welcomePage, page }) => {
  runner.setVideoAndTraceName('my-feature-e2e');
  await welcomePage.handleWelcomePage(true);
  await waitForPodmanMachineStartup(page); // If Podman machine needed
});

test.afterAll(async ({ runner }) => {
  await runner.close();
});
```

### 3. Polling for Async State

Use `playExpect.poll()` for checking async operations:

```typescript
await playExpect
  .poll(async () => await volumesPage.waitForVolumeExists(volumeName), {
    timeout: 25_000,
  })
  .toBeTruthy();
```

### 4. Platform-Specific Tests

```typescript
import { isWindows } from '/@/utility/platform';

test('Linux/Mac only', async ({ navigationBar }) => {
  test.skip(!!isWindows, 'Skipped on Windows');
  // test implementation
});
```

### 5. Test Tags

```typescript
test.describe('Feature', { tag: ['@smoke', '@windows_sanity'] }, () => {
  test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });
  // tests
});
```

**Available tags:**

- `@smoke` - Core smoke tests
- `@windows_sanity` - Windows sanity check tests
- `@macos_sanity` - Mac OS sanity check tests
- `@k8s_e2e` - Kubernetes tests
- `@k8s_sanity` - Kubernetes sanity check tests
- `@pdmachine` - Podman machine tests
- `@update-install` - Update installation tests
- `@managed-configuration` - Managed configuration tests
- `@podman-remote` - Remote podman tests
- `@ui-stress` - Non functional UI stress tests
- `@experimental` - Experimental features tests

### 6. File Naming Convention

- Smoke tests: `[feature]-smoke.spec.ts`
- Feature tests: `[feature].spec.ts`
- Special: `special-specs/[category]/[feature].spec.ts`

## Test Execution Modes

### Development Mode

```bash
pnpm test:e2e  # Uses electron from node_modules
```

### Production Mode

```bash
pnpm compile:current
PODMAN_DESKTOP_BINARY="/path/to/dist/linux-unpacked/podman-desktop" pnpm test:e2e
```

### External Repository

```bash
export PODMAN_DESKTOP_ARGS="/path/to/podman-desktop"
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Essential Podman Desktop Utilities

**Key utility modules:**

- [src/utility/operations.ts](src/utility/operations.ts) - Container/image/volume operations (`deleteContainer`, `deleteImage`, etc.)
- [src/utility/wait.ts](src/utility/wait.ts) - Wait helpers (`waitForPodmanMachineStartup`, polling utilities)
- [src/utility/cleanup.ts](src/utility/cleanup.ts) - Resource cleanup functions
- [src/utility/platform.ts](src/utility/platform.ts) - Platform detection (`isWindows`, `isMac`, `isLinux`)
- [src/utility/kubernetes.ts](src/utility/kubernetes.ts) - Kubernetes helpers

**Key models:**

- [src/model/core/states.ts](src/model/core/states.ts) - Container/Pod/Volume states
- [src/model/core/types.ts](src/model/core/types.ts) - Type definitions

## Configuration Files

**Root project files:**

- [package.json](../../package.json) - All E2E test scripts (see scripts whose names start with `test:e2e:`)
- [playwright.config.ts](../../playwright.config.ts) - Output dir, timeout (90s), reporters, single worker

**CI workflows:**

- [.github/workflows/e2e-main.yaml](../../.github/workflows/e2e-main.yaml) - Main E2E workflow
- [.github/workflows/e2e-kubernetes-main.yaml](../../.github/workflows/e2e-kubernetes-main.yaml) - K8s tests
- [.github/workflows/pr-check.yaml](../../.github/workflows/pr-check.yaml) - PR validation

## CI Artifacts & Debugging

**Artifacts uploaded on CI failure:**

- Traces (`.zip`) - `pnpm exec playwright show-trace <file.zip>`
- Videos (`.webm`) - Screen recordings
- Screenshots - Embedded in HTML report
- HTML reports - `pnpm exec playwright show-report <path>`

**Download from GitHub:**

1. Navigate to failed workflow run
2. Download `e2e-tests` or `k8s-e2e-tests` artifact
3. Extract and view traces/reports locally

For detailed debugging techniques, see [skill debugging section](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/SKILL.md#debugging-tests).

## Fast Iteration Tips

**Run single test:**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test tests/playwright/src/specs/volume-smoke.spec.ts --ui
```

**Filter by pattern:**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test tests/playwright/src/specs/ --grep volume
pnpm test:e2e:smoke  # Runs @smoke tagged tests
```

**Run a specific suite by name** (no need to modify package.json):

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:suite volume-smoke
```

Then iterate with `pnpm test:e2e:suite <name>` if you have run `test:e2e:build` before.

For more debugging methods, see [skill debugging section](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/SKILL.md#debugging-tests).

## Example: Podman Desktop Test

> See [skill examples](../../.agents/skills/playwright-testing/examples.md) for general patterns. This shows PD-specific usage.

```typescript
import { expect as playExpect, test } from '/@/utility/fixtures';
import { waitForPodmanMachineStartup } from '/@/utility/wait';

const volumeName = 'test-volume';

test.beforeAll(async ({ runner, welcomePage, page }) => {
  runner.setVideoAndTraceName('volume-example-e2e');
  await welcomePage.handleWelcomePage(true);
  await waitForPodmanMachineStartup(page);
});

test.afterAll(async ({ runner, navigationBar }) => {
  try {
    const volumesPage = await navigationBar.openVolumes();
    if (await volumesPage.waitForVolumeExists(volumeName)) {
      await volumesPage.deleteVolume(volumeName);
    }
  } finally {
    await runner.close();
  }
});

test.describe('Volume operations', { tag: ['@smoke'] }, () => {
  test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });

  test('Create and verify volume', async ({ navigationBar }) => {
    const volumesPage = await navigationBar.openVolumes();
    await playExpect(volumesPage.heading).toBeVisible();

    const createVolumePage = await volumesPage.openCreateVolumePage(volumeName);
    await createVolumePage.createVolume(volumeName);

    await playExpect
      .poll(async () => await volumesPage.waitForVolumeExists(volumeName), {
        timeout: 25_000,
      })
      .toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

#### 2. [playwright-trace-analysis](../../.agents/skills/playwright-trace-analysis/SKILL.md)

**Purpose:** Analyze Playwright trace files to diagnose test failures and flaky behavior

**Use when:**

- A test failed and you have a `trace.zip` file
- Investigating flaky tests
- Need root cause analysis from CI artifacts
- Comparing passing vs failing traces

**Provides:**

- Step-by-step failure investigation
- Root cause identification with evidence
- Flakiness detection
- Timeline and screenshot analysis

- Root cause (Confirmed/Likely/Unknown)
- Recommended fix with file:line references

**Example prompts:**

- "Analyze this trace.zip file"
- "Why did this test fail?"
- "Is this failure flaky or deterministic?"
- "Compare these two traces"

#### 3. [investigate-gh-run](../../.agents/skills/investigate-gh-run/SKILL.md)

**Purpose:** Deep investigation of CI/CD test failures from GitHub Actions runs

**Use when:**

- Performing regression analysis

**Provides:**

- Automated artifact download and analysis
- Run history pattern detection (isolated, chronic, regression)
- Trace analysis delegation
- Commit correlation for regressions
- Platform-specific failure patterns

**Workflow:**

1. Gathers run data (logs, artifacts, history) in parallel
2. Classifies failure type (infra, build error, UI/test failure)
3. Downloads relevant artifacts
4. Delegates to trace-analysis if needed
5. Produces comprehensive failure report

**Example prompts:**

- "Investigate this CI run: https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/12345"
- "Why did E2E tests fail on this PR?"
- "Analyze GitHub Actions run #12345"

#### 4. [mcp-testing](../../.agents/skills/mcp-testing/SKILL.md)

**Purpose:** Interactively explore and test the Podman Desktop UI using the `podman-desktop-mcp` MCP server — supports both production (installed app) and development (`pnpm watch`) modes

**Use when:**

- Quickly verifying a UI change during development without writing test code
- Testing the production (installed) Podman Desktop app interactively
- Exploring new or unfamiliar UI flows before writing page objects
- Debugging a specific user workflow or UI issue interactively
- Manual acceptance testing in development or production

**Provides:**

- Automated startup of production app or `pnpm watch` (cross-platform, no manual steps)
- Live connection to the running Electron app via CDP
- Screenshot, snapshot, click, fill, evaluate — all MCP-driven
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux/Fedora/RHEL, Windows)
- Troubleshooting guidance for DevTools targets, port conflicts, and CDP issues

**Example prompts:**

- "Explore the pods page"
- "Show me what the Settings > Resources page looks like"
- "Verify the image pull dialog works"
- "Test the onboarding flow on the production app"
